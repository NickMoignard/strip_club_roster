This iOS app is designed for the manager of a Gentlemens Lounge to dynamically update a digital Roster for a strip club

The Problem: 

Gentlemens Lounge's can have from 20 - 100 dancers working at once.
Each dancer will perform multiple times throughout the night in a variety of locations around each venue.

Each night a roster for the dancers is created by the manager on paper. Currently the manager has to either handwrite
copies of the original sheet or individually remind each dancer.

Rosters are created by hand throughout the night, as they are subject to change at very short notice due to 
girls giving private dances.

Solution:

Create a digital Roster stored in the cloud (Ruby on Rails : RESTFul JSON API)
Display Roster on televisions throughout each venue ( Single View Webpage )
Give venue managers an iPad with an app to edit the roster ( iOS Application )
